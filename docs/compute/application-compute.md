# Application Compute

## Intro
* Deploy your application artifacts
* Design for horizontal scalability
* Upgrade in place

## Why This Matters
* Standardized compute eases app config & deployment
* you need a way to scale horizontally

## Our Recommendation
* ECS
* Deploy with containers

## How To Do It
* Use SI to create an ECS cluster
* Define tasks and load balancers as needed
* Deploy your application artifact

## Alternatives/Notes
* EC2 autoscale groups and cloud-init
* EKS
