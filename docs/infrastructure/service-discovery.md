## Intro
*

## Why This Matters
* Applications and services rarely operate in a vacuum

## Our Recommendation
* Environment variables
* TOML config
* DNS

## How To Do It
* Standardized DNS names for services
* Configuration values for what the environment's service names are (dev vs prod)

## Alternatives/Notes
* Static addressing?
* Rebuild artifacts to change hard-coded config

## Dependencies
* [Application Configuration](/foundation/application-configuration)
