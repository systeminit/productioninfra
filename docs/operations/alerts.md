# Alerts

## Intro
* When things go wrong, you need to know about it
* set up a rotation amongst all your developers

## Why This Matters
* Things will go wrong. You need to know when/where/how they do.

## Our Recommendation
* FireHydrant/PagerDuty/etc.
* Developers should be on call for the services they develop
* SREs / Operations personnel should also be in the rotation

## How To Do It
* Thresholds & triggers on observability data/metrics
* Weekly on call rotations
* Consistent retrospectives on every alert

## Alternatives/Notes
* Wait for people to notice

## Dependencies
* [Observability](/infrastructure/observability)
